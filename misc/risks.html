<h1>Potential Risk of Having Robots in the Food Service Industry</h1>

<p>Research by Dodel & Mesch (2020) highlights that the implementation of robots in various industries, including restaurants, is driven by the desire to replace human workers in manual and intense labor jobs.
   The increasing use of artificial intelligence-powered robots can result in a reduction in the human workforce, leading to concerns about unemployment and job displacement.</p>
<p>Gebrayel (2023) raises concerns about the cost and maintenance associated with implementing robots in restaurants.
   While robots can offer efficiency and automation, they require initial investment, regular maintenance, and repairs, which can be costly for restaurant owners. Additionally, the fear of job loss among human workers persists, as robots are viewed as potential replacements for human labor.</p>
<p>The presence of robots in restaurants can attract children due to their novelty and interactive nature.
   However, Seyitoglu & Ivanov (2022) report that some customers have expressed dissatisfaction with the service provided by robots, particularly in terms of food portion sizes and the ability to cater to individual preferences.
   These challenges highlight the need for further refinement and improvement in the capabilities of robots to ensure successful and satisfactory customer service.</p>
