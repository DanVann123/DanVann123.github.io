<h1>Robot for restaurants and fear of unemployment</h1>

<p>The chosen technology/topic for analysis is the integration of robots in restaurants and the associated fear of unemployment. This specific focus allows for a nuanced examination of the societal implications at various levels of analysis.
   The level of analysis encompasses both culture and organization, exploring how cultural norms and organizational structures influence the adoption and impact of robotic systems. The responsibility dimension considers the responsibility of both individuals and professionals in addressing the challenges and opportunities posed by this technology.
    Ethical concerns center around power dynamics and equity, as the introduction of robots raises questions about job displacement and the fair distribution of benefits. This technology falls under the category of service robotics within the broader spectrum of technological advancements.</p>
