<h1>The Rise of Robotic Automation in the Food Service Industry</h1>

<p>Seo & Lee (2021) suggest that the use of robots in restaurants presents a great opportunity for decreasing COVID-19 transmission rates.
   Robots can minimize human contact, reducing the risk of virus spread and ensuring a safer dining experience for customers and staff. Additionally, the absence of hourly wages for robots can contribute to cost savings for restaurant owners, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Robots can be employed in conjunction with human workers to optimize workload distribution and assist with challenging tasks.
   By utilizing robots to handle repetitive or physically demanding tasks, human workers can focus on more complex and creative aspects of restaurant operations, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the context of customer service, robots have the ability to welcome customers and take orders directly from tables. 
  This streamlined process improves efficiency and reduces wait times, enhancing the overall dining experience. Once the orders are received, robots can swiftly transmit them to the kitchen, where human workers can leverage their culinary skills to prepare and cook the food. 
  This collaboration between robots and human workers combines the benefits of automation with the expertise and craftsmanship of humans.</p>
